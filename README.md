- native browser behaviour given, like middle click which opens link in a new tab
- updates also information in head (title, ... )
- browser navigation support

## Demo

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- domparser polyfill for crossbrowser support (js included)

### How to use
- include js files in head information of your template: domparser.polyfill.js and page.transition.min.js
- include css file in head information of your template: page.transition.css

#### Example call of the pageTransition function with default options

    <script type="text/javascript">
        pageTransition({
            effectClasses: [ 'slide' ],
            effectClassesReverse: [ 'slide', 'reverse' ],
            afterSlideFunction: function() {
                /* Placeholder for a callback to get executed after each page transition. */
            },
            ajaxLoader: 'ajax-loader',
            noSlideAttr: 'data-no-slide',
            contentContainerSelector: 'body',
            cssSlideDuration: 705,
            headElementsToReplace: 'meta, link, title'
        });
    </script>

#### Options description

- effectClasses: css class how the sliding should behave (feel free to modify and write your own)
- effectClassesReverse: css class how sliding should behave after browser navigation (back button)
- afterSlideFunction: some js stuff which will be called after slide has finished
- ajaxLoader: id of your ajax loader container which will be appended to your page before slide
- noSlideAttr: data-attribute which makes links not sliding
- contentContainerSelector: selector of what should slide
- cssSlideDuration: Duration of slidingeffect
- headElementsToReplace: choose what should be replaced in head of page

### Good to know

- ONLY RELATIVE PATH COMPATIBLE: this plugin works ONLY with relative paths, links with absolute paths (http://, mailto:, ftp://) etc. will be called normal
- Same issue with links that have hashtags in its address (anchor, JS stuff â€¦)
- I don't know if i really had all exceptions in my mind, but i will extend this plugin soon to make it perfect ;-)
